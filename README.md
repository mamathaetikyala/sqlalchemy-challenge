The purpose of this challenge is query database using sqlalchemy session quries and draw analutical conlusions on precipitation and temperature data of different stations. And also build web app(API) exposure of data in json format using Flask module.

Querying using sql queries(sqlalchemy). Draw histogram using pandas and matplotlib.

data provided consists of 6 files of different stations. database consists of two tables 1. measurement 2. station

## Getting Started

1. Run jupyter notebook file to upload data from database file
2. Run analysis code blocks to derive conlusions on precipitation and temperature data

## Installing
